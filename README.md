# tracing-layer-discord
`tracing-layer-discord` provides a [`Layer`] implementation for sending [`tracing`] events to Discord. 

## Synopsis

[`DiscordLayer`] sends POST requests via [`tokio`] and [`reqwest`] to a [Discord Webhook URL](https://api.discord.com/messaging/webhooks) for each new tracing event. The format of the `text` field is statically defined.

This layer also looks for an optional [`JsonStorageLayer`] [`extension`](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/0.2.5/tracing_subscriber/registry/struct.ExtensionsMut.html) on the parent [`span`] of each event. This extension may contain additional contextual information for the parent span of an event, which is included into the Discord message. 

## Installation

Configure the dependencies and pull directly from GitHub:

```toml
[dependencies]
tokio = "1.0"
tracing = "0.1"
tracing-layer-discord = "0.1"
```

## Examples 

See the full list of examples in [examples/](./examples).

### Simple

In this simple example, a layer is created using Discord configuration in the environment. An orphaned event (one with no parent span) and an event occurring within a span are created in three separate futures, and a number of messages are sent quickly to Discord.

#### Discord Messages

This screenshots shows the first three Discord messages sent while running this example. More messages are sent but were truncated from these images.

##### Discord Blocks

By default, messages are sent using [Discord Blocks](https://api.discord.com/block-kit). Here's an example:

#### Code example

Run this example locally using the following commands:
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/yanorei32/tracing-layer-discord.git
$ cd tracing-layer-discord
$ cargo run --example simple
```

You must have Discord configuration exported in the environment.

```rust
use regex::Regex;
use tracing::{info, warn, instrument};
use tracing_subscriber::{layer::SubscriberExt, Registry};

use tracing_layer_discord::{EventFilters, DiscordLayer};

#[instrument]
pub async fn create_user(id: u64) -> u64 {
    network_io(id).await;
    info!(param = id, "A user was created");
    id
}

#[instrument]
pub async fn network_io(id: u64) {
    warn!(user_id = id, "some network io happened");
}

pub async fn controller() {
    info!("Orphan event without a parent span");
    let (id1, id2, id3) = tokio::join!(create_user(2), create_user(4), create_user(6));
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // Only show events from where this example code is the target.
    let target_to_filter: EventFilters = Regex::new("simple").unwrap().into();

    // Initialize the layer and an async background task for sending our Discord messages.
    let (discord_layer, background_worker) = DiscordLayer::builder("my-app-name".to_string(), target_to_filter).build();
    // Initialize the global default subscriber for tracing events.
    let subscriber = Registry::default().with(discord_layer);
    tracing::subscriber::set_global_default(subscriber).unwrap();

    // Perform our application code that needs tracing and Discord messages.
    controller().await;
    // Waits for all Discord messages to be sent before exiting.
    background_worker.shutdown().await;
}
